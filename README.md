🍷 Wine Clustering Explorer

Wine Clustering Explorer is an interactive web app built with Gradio that allows users to explore unsupervised clustering on wine data. Users can login, select clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN), adjust parameters, and visualize clusters in 2D PCA plots along with clustering metrics like Silhouette Score, Davies–Bouldin Index, and Calinski–Harabasz Index. The app is designed for easy experimentation and learning with real-world datasets.
